## 🌟 Project Overview
This engine is a **Symbolic Computation Suite** developed to automate and visualize high-level mathematics. While standard calculators provide numerical approximations, this tool performs **exact symbolic manipulation**, handling constants like $\pi$, $e$, and complex radicals just as they appear in JEE Advanced and Japanese EJU (Examination for Japanese University Admission) papers.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Exact Symbolic Logic:** Performs differentiation and integration using `SymPy` logic trees rather than float-point approximations.
* **Interactive Calculus Dashboard:** Dynamic plotting of functions and their derivatives using `Matplotlib` and `NumPy`.
* **LaTeX Rendering:** Beautiful, textbook-style mathematical output for clear result verification.
* **Linear Algebra & Complex Suite:** Support for matrix determinants, inverses, and Euler-form complex number rotations.

## 🎌 The "Sikar to Japan" Context
In Japanese engineering curricula (such as those at the University of Tokyo or Kyoto University), a deep understanding of **Symbolic Logic** and **Differential Equations** is mandatory. 

This project serves as a bridge:
1.  **Phase 1 (Sikar):** Mastering the foundational JEE mathematics.
2.  **Phase 2 (The Bridge):** Automating that math using Python to build engineering tools.
3.  **Phase 3 (Japan):** Applying these computational skills to advanced robotics and structural engineering.
